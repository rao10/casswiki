This is a project intended to restore Casswiki website from [archive.org]( https://web.archive.org/web/20160315225039/http://thecasswiki.net/index.php?title=CassWiki:Home) This is done by converting the HTML articles into Obsidian markdown format and publish it using "Obsidian Publish".
- All HTML articles are converted to markdown using [urltomarkdown.com](https://urltomarkdown.com/)
    If the specific article is no longer in the archive.org, That articles is either ommitted or blank article is created.
  Many of the images are not archived. Those are identified and pointed to the images pulled from FOTCM Casswiki pdf
- All the  Archive hyper links are pointed back to Obsidian articles and images.

- Current Obsidian Publish location for the Casswiki is  [here](https://publish.obsidian.md/cassquotes/Casswiki/Introductory+Pages/CassWiki+Home) . You can search and read the content there.
